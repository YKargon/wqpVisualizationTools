#' Simplify HUC Shapes from WBD --------------------------------------------
#' 
#' Simplifies HUC boundaries from WBD dataset using ms_simplify, saves as .gpkg
#' 
#' Note: if having issues relating to memory/speed attempt ms_simplify's 'sys=T' parameter, which requires
#' system version of map shaper to be installed (read more: ?ms_simplify)
#' Saved gpkg doesn't seem to store CRS/ESPG number
#'
#' @param wbd_path String, filepath for st_read
#' @param level Numeric, HUC level for simplification
